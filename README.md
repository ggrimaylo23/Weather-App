# Weather-App
A weather app that uses Open Weather App API to display the weather. 
The design of the site was made in CSS and HTML, while the required data for the weather was obtained using API calls in JavaScript. 
The background image for each city was obtained from the Unsplash Image API. You can enter a city name in the search box, and the weather of the city will appear and a background image
of the city will also appear. I tested the Weather App using the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
